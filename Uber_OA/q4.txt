You are given operations, an array containing the following two types of operations:
• [0, a, b] - Create and save a rectangle of size a * b;
• [1, a, b] - Answer the question: "Could every one of the earlier saved rectangles fit in a box of size a * b". It is possible to rotate rectangles by 90 degrees; ie: a rectangle of dimensions a x b can be rotated so that its dimensions are b x a . Note: We're trying to fit each rectangle within the box separately (not all at the same time).
Your task is to return an array of booleans, representing the answers to the second type of operation, in the order they appear.
Note that the operations should be proceeded iteratively, so when operations [i] is executed only the results of the previous operations 0, 1 , ...., i - 1 are available.
Example
• For operations = [[1, 1, 1]] , the output should be solution (operations) = [true].
There are no rectangles, so they all can be fit in any box.
• For operations = [[0, 1, 3], [0, 4, 2], [1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 2]], the output should be
solution (operations) = [true, false].
