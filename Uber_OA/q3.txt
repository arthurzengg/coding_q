Imagine that you are formatting the text that will appear on newspaper page, which requires you to « format the text on the page. The text is provided to you in the following format:
• paragraphs is an array of paragraphs, where each paragraph is represented by an array containing chunks of text.
• width represents the maximum number of characters that can fit on each line of the newspaper page.
Your task is to produce a newspaper page according to the following specifications:
• For each paragraph paragraphs [i], start a new line and add the text from paragraphs [i][j] in order. When the portions of text is together on a line, they should be separated by 1 space.
• You cannot break up the portions of text. So, if adding the next portion would cause you to exceed width, you will need to start a new line and add that text there.
• You may end up with leftover space on a line if the size of the text (including separating spaces) is less than width. If this happens, align the text to the center by adding spaces around it:
• If the amount of leftover space on the line is even, add an equal number of spaces before and after the text.
• If the amount of leftover space on the line is odd, add an equal number of spaces before and after the text. You'll have an extra space left over; add it after the text.
• Include a rectangular border of asterisks (* character) around the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the resulting newspaper page. These characters don't count towards the width but are added for aesthetic reasons.
Return the resulting newspaper page as an array of strings, in which the ith string represents the ith line of the newspaper page. It is guaranteed that it will be possible to format the input paragraphs into a newspaper page as described.
Note: You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than  O(paragraphs.length * paragraphs [0].length * width) will fit within the execution time limit.

For paragraphs = [["hello", "world"], I"How", "areYou", "doing"], ["Please look",
"and align", "to center"]] and width = 16, the output should be

solution(paragraphs, width) = ["******************",
                               "*  hello world   *",
                               "*How areYou doing*",
                               "*  Please look   *",
                               "*   and align    *",
                               "*   to center    *",
                               "******************"]
